# The Claylings

A Godot 4.6 2D colony simulation and real-time strategy (RTS) defense game where autonomous clay agents ("Claylings") harvest resources, farm crops, craft equipment, and construct a thriving settlement in a procedurally generated world. Players manage civilian logistics by day and command tactical military squads by night to defend their sacred Crystal against escalating waves of nocturnal creatures.

## Features

- **Autonomous Agent Simulation & Needs**: Driven by a modular Finite State Machine (FSM), Claylings autonomously handle colony tasks (hauling, delivering, constructing, farming, foraging, mining, chopping) while managing vital personal needs like hunger and energy.
- **Colony Logistics & Multi-Tier Crafting**: Comprehensive production chain featuring storage depots, crafting stations (Workbench, Furnace, Forge, Loom, Chopping Block), recipe queues, dynamic fuel consumption, and an intelligent task-quota and reservation system to prevent worker bottlenecks.
- **RTS Squad Combat & Tactical Formations**: Seamless transition between civilian life and military defense with Call to Arms (`X`) and Call to Work (`Z`). Equip Claylings via Weapon Racks into specialized combat classes (Spearmen, Knights, Archers), command units with RTS box selection, target priorities, and dynamic drag-and-drop line formations with wall collision validation.
- **Procedural World Generation & Ecology**: FastNoiseLite-powered procedural map generation producing organic landmasses, water bodies, impassable cliff walls, harvestable flora (trees, saplings, fiber bushes), and vein clusters of valuable ores (copper, iron, gold).
- **Day/Night Cycle & Nocturnal Wave Defense**: Real-time atmospheric lighting and day-night cycle driving procedural enemy wave spawns (melee Blue Spiders, ranged Purple Spiders) targeting the central Crystal, with difficulty scaling dynamically across surviving days.
- **Grid Agriculture & Harvest Zones**: Dynamic soil moisture and evaporation physics, crop growth staging (carrots), and draggable harvest zones (`M`) for automated mass gathering.
- **Colony Management HUD**: Interactive UI suite including a Task Priority & Quota management window, category-based Build Menu, Clayling Status Inspector, Day/Clock tracker, and context-sensitive radial interaction menus.
